# SEFAZ MOCKET SERVICES
It's just a simple nodeJs express based webserver to "mock" some Brazilian SEFAZ NF-e/NFC-e services.  
The main idea is to return a mocked value simulating a SEFAZ return.

### Install
```bash
git clone <repo url>
cd sefaz-mocked
npm install
```

### Run
```bash
npm start
```


### Extra configs
You can change the behavior using the .env config file.
